# Security Guidelines for Lucid

If you have found a security vulnerability in Lucid, please follow the
guidelines below to disclose it to us safely.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@roost.moe**.
Include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Any relevant logs, screenshots, or proof-of-concept code
- The version of Lucid you are using
- Your assessment of the severity (e.g., low, medium, high, critical)

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and aim to provide
an initial assessment within 5 business days.

## What NOT to Do

- **Do not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Public
  disclosure before a fix is available puts all users at risk.
- **Do not** exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate
  it.
- **Do not** access, modify, or delete data belonging to other users.
- **Do not** perform denial-of-service attacks or any testing that could degrade
  the service for others.
- **Do not** use automated scanners or tools against production systems without
  prior written permission.
- **Do not** disclose the vulnerability to third parties before it has been
  resolved.

## Disclosure Process

1. You report the vulnerability privately to **security@roost.moe**.
2. We acknowledge your report and begin our investigation.
3. We work on a fix and coordinate a release timeline.
4. Once the fix is released, we publicly disclose the vulnerability with
   appropriate credit to the reporter (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities that affect the Lucid project itself.
Issues in third-party dependencies should be reported to the respective
maintainers, though we appreciate a heads-up if a dependency vulnerability
directly impacts Lucid.

Thank you for helping keep Lucid and its users safe.
